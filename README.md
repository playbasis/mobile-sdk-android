# Playbasis Android SDK

Playbasis Android SDK is a brand new Android SDK from Playbasis for helping developers integrate their mobile apps with Playbasis gamification API.

The Android SDK is designed to work effectively with mobile devices. For example, it provides:

  - High-level function API calls so that developers will find it is relatively easy to work with Playbasis API
  - However, the SDK didn't limit the access to low-level API calls so that, if needed, developers still can have a finer control
  - Automatically parse JSON responses into Java objects
  - Works offline when there is no internet connection as the requests will be stored on the device (in an encrypted way)
  - Expose phone native features like phone events so it will very easy for developers to track their users' actions and learn more about their behavior
